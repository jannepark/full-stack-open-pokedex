# 11.1 Warming up
In this text the hypothetical application is written in Java.

For linting tools like `Checkstyle` or `PMD` are commonly used in Java development. `JUnit` and `Selenium` are popular testing frameworks that ensure the application is bug-free and meets expected functionalities. `Maven` and `Gradle` are popular tools for building the Java application, allowing us to compile, package and deploy it effectively.

There are several alternative options for setting up the CI environment besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions. `GitLab CI/CD` is a robust cloud-based option. Another alternative is `CircleCI`, known for its Docker support and easy configuration. CircleCI does not require a dedicated internal server as it is a cloud-hosted platform. `Travis CI` can also be considered as it provides support for a multitude of languages and has a good integration with GitHub.

Given the 6 member team with an impending release, a cloud-based CI may be most the beneficial. It provides fast setup and scalability, allowing easy collaboration and fast, concurrent builds, accelerating the release.

Finding an appropriate setup between a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment greatly relies on specific needs and resources of the team. a Cloud-based environment offers ease of setup, with high scalability, and reduced maintenance time. a Self-hosted environment provides better control and customization, possibly better security and data privacy.
To make an decision between these two, you would need to know how large the project is likely to get, how much scalability is required, security and privacy needs and does the team have the necessary resources and bandwidth to maintain a self-hosted environment.
